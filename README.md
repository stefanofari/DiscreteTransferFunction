# DiscreteTransferFunction Library for Arduino

This library provides a way to implement discrete transfer functions on Arduino platforms.

## Features
- Apply discrete feedback and feedforward filtering.
- Utilize customizable coefficients for versatile filtering applications.

## Usage
See the `examples/BasicUsage` sketch for an example on how to use this library. Modify the coefficients in the `BasicUsage.ino` to fit your specific system.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository into your Arduino libraries folder.
2. Include the library in your Arduino sketch and follow the example to implement the desired transfer function.
